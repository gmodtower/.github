## About GMTower
GMod Tower is a collection of various online multiplayer games that each have different genres of gameplay. Each game can be played with 4-90 players across the globe and are complete modifications of the Source engine.

The lobby aspect is what makes it all work; Players connect to a central lobby server and group up with other players to play these multiplayer games. While in the lobby, players can also watch videos together, socialize and make friends, buy furniture and items for their in-game house, customize their look (hats, skins, etc.), gamble their fictional currency away at the casino, play trivia and arcade games, party at the nightclub or bar, and participate and various daily activities.
